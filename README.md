TASK-MANAGER APP


This is a simple project that im still working on, so the readme is still a bit scanty. Its an app that allows users to create tasks and assign deadlines and urgency to them.
It includes a prioritization feature that sorts tasks based on urgency first and then deadlines.
I added drag and drop functionality between the complete and incomplete tasks sections that updates the task status accordingly.
Uses JWT Authentication for user login and signup and makes sure each account has its own tasks.


Currently in development. Readme will be updated when completed.
